        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The heading element can be seen with a h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 (h1 being the largest element) and there should only be one h1 on each page</li>
          <li>The p element can be used for paragraphs</li>
          <li>The section element can be used to structure the website</li>
          <li>The br element is used for a new line break</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>size can be determined by px, percentage</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color. </li>
        </ul>

          <li>A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>Order matters in a JavaScript file as for example a variable will show up as undefined if it is called before it is created</li>
          <li>functions are a block of reusable code which can be called many times</li>
          <li>if statement are conditional statements which can be used to make decisions within our code and can be put into functions.</li>
